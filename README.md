# AI Lens — VS Code Extension

AI Lens helps you understand how much of your workspace was generated by AI. It reads Cursor’s SQLite database and your editor changes, matches AI items to code lines using hashing, and shows results in a dashboard.

## Features
- Real‑time monitoring of AI events (Cursor)
- Line‑level matching via hashing inference
- Workspace stats: total lines, AI lines, source breakdown
- Dashboard with per‑file details and export
